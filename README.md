# Repository structure

The important directories in this repository are:

- `data/`: example data sets to use in (some of the) lessons;
- `chapters/`: Quarto documents (.qmd files) with code and text to be used in
practicals;
- `code/`: .R scripts with helper functions designed to make lessons 
easier to follow;
- `output/`: pre-computed output files to avoid long runtimes and dependence
on external software (e.g., BUSCO, IQ-TREE 2, etc).

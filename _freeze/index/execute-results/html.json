Phylogenomics\n2. Gene set enrichment\n\n## Setup\n\nTo run the code in this book, you will need to install:\n\n1.  R (\\>=4.2.0): go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/), choose your OS (Windows, Linux, or macOS), and follow the installation instructions.\n\n2.  RStudio Desktop: go to the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the installer for your OS.\n\n3.  IQ-TREE 2: go to the [IQ-TREE download page](http://www.iqtree.org/#download) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.\n\nAfter installing R and RStudio, you will need to install some required R \npackages. To do that, open RStudio and execute the code below in your console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install BiocManager\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\n# Use {BiocManager} to install required packages (if they are not installed)\npackages <- c(\n    \"here\", \n    \"cogeqc\",\n    \"Biostrings\", \n    \"tidyverse\", \n    \"ape\",\n    \"msa\", \n    \"tidyverse\",\n    \"SummarizedExperiment\",\n    \"DESeq2\",\n    \"clusterProfiler\",\n    \"enrichplot\",\n    \"org.Mm.eg.db\",\n    \"universalmotif\"\n)\n\nlapply(packages, function(x) {\n    if(!require(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n        BiocManager::install(x, ask = FALSE, update = FALSE)\n    }\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter that, you should have everything ready.\n",
